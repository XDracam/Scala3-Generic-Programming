# Generic Programming in Scala 3

Short tutorial accompanying a video I made about generic programming in Scala 3. 
Includes examples of the most common features that people previously used Shapeless for. 

Recommended Usage:

1. Clone project into IntelliJ with the newest (ideally nightly) Scala plugin installed
2. just scroll through the source files in order and click on the play button next to `@main` examples to run them

Alternatively you can use any other SBT-compatible tooling. But you might need to explicitly specify which @main to run. 

Or you can just view the source files in github and believe me that everything runs and compiles.

Feedback, comments and pull requests are appreciated! Enjoy!

### Licensing

I added a default MIT license without much thought. If you want to use this in a context that is beyond that licence's scope, then you can just ask me and I'll most likely let you use this anyway. It's just that without any License I'd have explicit copyright on this project, which would be less open.
