# Generic Programming in Scala 3

Short tutorial accompanying a video I made about generic programming in Scala 3. 
Includes examples of the most common features that people previously used Shapeless for. 

Recommended Usage:

1. Clone project into IntelliJ with the newest (ideally nightly) Scala plugin installed
2. just scroll through the source files in order and click on the play button next to `@main` examples to run them

Alternatively you can use any other SBT-compatible tooling. But you might need to explicitly specify which @main to run.
